I'm a cool coder who likes coding in C#. I do code in other languages, but that is my favorite.
I like cats and dogs 🐱🐶, but cats are better bc they are calmer!

At my middle school, I broke the admin system, and here is how you do it too:
Test 1: Use Proxies:

Test 2: "website.com/" = blocked, but "website.com./" is sometimes real and can be unblocked.
Test 3: Close out the app that is blocking everything (duh), but sometimes they have DNS blockers too.
Test 4: Use own pc
